{% block meta_description %}A short bio of Lochlan McIntosh, a web developer located in Portland, Oregon.{% endblock %}


{% block shared %}
    <p>My name is Lochlan and I like to build thingsâ€”some of which you can find on <a href="http://www.github.com/Lochlan/">Github</a>.</p>

    <p>I am a native Portlander and life-long technology enthusiast.  Other than spending time with my amazing wife and relaxing with my dog Rupert, my favorite thing in the world is writing software.  I also like eating at French restaurants (my favorites are <a href="http://lecrocodilerestaurant.com/">Le Crocodile</a> and <a href="http://stjackpdx.com/">St. Jack</a>), playing antiquated video games, and hiking the Council Crest and Pittock Mansion trails.</p>

    <p>My favorite platform to develop for is the web. I've been working with it since childhood in 1995, during the reign of things like <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>, Perl/CGI, page counters, and every other obsolete hallmark of the good old days.  I had a handful of paid jobs in middle school and high school and eventually got serious about doing contract work in 2006 with LAMP stacks.  Since then I've earned a Computer Science degree while continuing my trajectory as a web-application developer and software engineer.</p>

    <p>Web development topics I'm currently interested in are:
        <ul>
            <li>Serverless application modeling</li>
            <li>GraphQL API architecture</li>
            <li>Automated testing</li>
            <li>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I am currently available for either full-time or contract work, please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> for details.</p>
